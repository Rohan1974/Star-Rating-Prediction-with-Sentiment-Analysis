## Title: Star Rating Prediction with Sentiment Analysis (Machine Learning & Deep Learning)

## Description:
This repository explores the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict star ratings and analyze sentiment from text data.
The project implements various algorithms and tools, including:

## Machine Learning Algorithms:
Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree Classifier

Support Vector Machine

## Deep Learning Models:
VADER

ROBERTA

BERT

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques:
Bag-of-Words (BoW)

NLTK library for data cleaning and preprocessing

## 1. Input:
Provide a text review of a cafe experience.

## 2. Preprocessing:
## We clean the text:
Convert to lowercase

Remove HTML tags

Advanced techniques like Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and chunking can be applied for deeper analysis.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis:
Each sentence's sentiment is analyzed using three models:

## VADER (lexicon-based): Identifies positive, negative, or neutral words.
## RoBERTa (deep learning): Powerful model trained on massive text data for sentiment analysis.
## BERT (deep learning): Another advanced deep learning model for sentiment understanding.
The result for each sentence is a score of "Negative," "Neutral," "Positive," and "Compound" (overall sentiment).

## 4. Star Rating Prediction:
Trained machine learning models analyze the preprocessed text and predict the most likely star rating for the cafe review.

## 5. Output:
Predicted star rating for the cafe.
Sentiment analysis results (sentiment category and compound score) for each model. 

## Conclusion:
This project combines machine learning and deep learning to provide a comprehensive analysis of cafe reviews, offering both a predicted rating and sentiment insights.
